# 🚗 Car Price Prediction - End-to-End MLOps Project

An end-to-end Machine Learning project to predict used car prices based on company, model, year, fuel type, and kilometers driven.

This project transforms raw, messy data scraped from Quikr.com into a production-ready ML web app with 92% accuracy.

## 📌 What This Project Includes
- Web scraping & data cleaning (handled missing values, outliers)
- Exploratory Data Analysis & feature engineering
- Linear Regression model with 0.92 R² score
- Interactive Flask web application
- Real-time price predictions
- Heroku cloud deployment
- Complete ML pipeline automation

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)
- Flask (Web Framework)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend)
- Git & GitHub (Version Control)
- Heroku (Cloud Deployment)

## 🔍 Features Used
- Car Company (Hyundai, Maruti, Honda, etc.)
- Car Model (i10, Swift, City, etc.)
- Year of Purchase
- Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
- Kilometers Driven

## 🚀 Project Pipeline
1. Data Collection → Scraped 1500+ listings from Quikr.com
2. Data Cleaning → Handled null values, formatted columns
3. EDA → Analyzed price trends by company, year, fuel
4. Feature Engineering → One-hot encoding for categories
5. Model Training → Linear Regression (92% accuracy)
6. Web Development → Flask app with user-friendly interface

## 🎯 Objective
To build a production-ready ML system that helps users estimate fair used car prices, making the second-hand car market more transparent and data-driven.
